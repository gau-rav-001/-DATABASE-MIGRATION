## How to Run the Migration

1. Export MySQL schema and data using `01_dump_mysql.sh`  
2. Modify and adapt the schema using `02_convert_schema.sql` as needed  
3. Run `pgloader` with `03_pgloader.load` to migrate data  
4. Execute validation queries from `04_data_validate.sql` to ensure data integrity  
5. Perform post-migration tasks with `05_post_migration_tasks.sql`  
6. In case of issues, refer to `06_rollback_instructions.md` for rollback procedures

## Notes

- Do not hardcode passwords in scripts; use environment variables or secure methods  
- Test migration on staging before production cutover  
- Review application compatibility with PostgreSQL after migration
